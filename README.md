Hey Everyone! This is my first project after learning HTML.
I have designed my portfolio website using PURE HTML!!!
Who says websites cannot be created using HTML. Though CSS is a vital part of adding styles, but that doesn't question the power of HTML right???

Adding The link to my Website :  http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html (Works Fine on Microsoft Edge)
                                
   http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html (For Chrome Users )
                                 
I have Also added small videos of my projects which give you a better understanding. Also the links to the source codes is also mentioned alongside.                                 


Adding a few references that I have used during my project building.
Hope this might help you!
