Hey Everyone! This is my first project after learning HTML.
I have designed my portfolio website using PURE HTML!!!
Who says websites cannot be created using HTML. Though CSS is a vital part of adding styles, but that doesn't question the power of HTML right???

The link to the Website is :       file:///C:/Users/KUNIKA%20SHARMA/Documents/GitHub/Portfolio-Website-using-HTML-ONLY-/index.html

(Copy the URL to Microsoft Edge to get a better experience of the autoplayed videos.)
                                 
I have Also added small videos of my projects which give you a better understanding. Also the links to the source codes is also mentioned alongside.                                 


Adding a few references that I have used during my project building.
Hope this might help you!
