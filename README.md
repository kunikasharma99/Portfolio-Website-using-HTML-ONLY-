HEY Everyone! This is my first project after learning HTML.
I have designed my portfolio website using PURE HTML!!!
Who says websites cannot be created using HTML. Though CSS is a vital part of adding styles, but that doesn't question the power of HTML right???

Adding a few references that I have used during my project building.
Hope this might help you!
